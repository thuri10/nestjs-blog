## Hello, I`m Martin

Martin is a kenyan-born Software developer and reverser currently doing application security.

This is my personal blog to share my adventures and learning experiences with the community. The blog focuses on different topics but not limited to application security. I play CTF`s during my free time to challenge my skills and meet new amazing people.

**Got any Question, idea, ?** Feel free to reach me out through **Mail**. I will be glad to help or assist you.
