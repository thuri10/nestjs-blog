# Insecure Logging for Sensitive data

The application implementation of debug logging in the `login` activity leads to leakage of the user password in the log files.

Example below is implementation of the insecureshop `login` activity .

```java
    String password = String.valueOf(textInputEditText2.getText());
    Log.d("userName", username);
    Log.d("password", password);
```

NB: "Remove all the debugging features before shipping application to production or release version".

Opening the `adb` logs anf grepping for `password`. you will be able to get password used to authenticate user.
