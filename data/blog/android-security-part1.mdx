# Introduction

This is a five part beginner series of Android application security with Vulnerable Android application examples. The application used in the first three part series is a vulnerable Android application developed by [@B3nac](https://twitter.com/B3nac).

The application is called **_InjuredAndroid_**, it covers different security concepts such as hardcoded secrets, weak cryptographic algorithms, misconfiguration, webview vulnerabilities etc. The application can be downloaded from the following provided links [playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=b3nac.injuredandroid) or [github](https://github.com/B3nac/InjuredAndroid).

For solving the challenges or following through the guides is you need to have an android phone or an emulator. For my case I will be using an android emulator throughout the series, my emulator of choice is android emulator which is part of android studio.

### Environment setup and Decompilation

For installation of application to the emulator we will use Android debug bridge(adb). adb is a set of command line tools which are installed as part of android studio. adb enables communication between emulator/real android phone with the connected computer.

To install the application, use install command as shown in the Linux terminal below.

```bash
adb install InjuredAndroid-1.0.12-release.apk
```

Launching the application in the emulator ,the interface will look like the image below.

Tools used throughout the series are:

1. [JADX](https://github.com/skylot/jadx)
2. Text Editor (visual studio)
3. Android Studio

JADX is a bundle of command line and GUI tools. jadx enables one to produce java source code from android Dex and APK files. This tool will aid us to decompile the android application to java code which is human readable.

> For reverse engineering/ code auditing of every application, you need to have a clear set of goal or objective of what you want to achieve. This helps narrow down the analysis and avoid many rabbit holes.

## FLAG ONE - LOGIN

**Goal : Input the right flag.**

For the first challenge is to get the correct flag. **flag** is a piece of reward if you do correct task you are asked to do. Looking at the decompiled code in the editor as shown below, there is an interesting function called **submitFlag**. submit flag function is responsible for validation of the user input.

```java
public final void submitFlag(View view) {
        EditText editText = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.editText2);
        C2724g.m882d(editText, "editText2");
        if (C2724g.m885a(editText.getText().toString(), "F1ag_0n3")) {
            Intent intent = new Intent(this, FlagOneSuccess.class);
            new FlagsOverview().m4085J(true);
            new ApplicationC1492j().m4065b(this, "flagOneButtonColor", true);
            startActivity(intent);
        }
    }
```

From the above code, the **FlagoneActivity** class implements a functionality which the user input is compared with hardcoded flag in the application.

The user entered flag string is compared with the hardcoded flag which is "**F1ag_0n3**". The method **m10785a** compares the two objects ( user input flag and hardcoded flag) and return a boolean depending on the result of the comparison of two objects. A boolean result can be either true or false.

```java
public static boolean m10785a(Object obj, Object obj2) {
        return obj == null ? obj2 == null : obj.equals(obj2);
    }
```

If the condition is True, new Intent is started which is **FlagOneSuccess**. Entering hardcoded flag as our input, we get a success message and color of **Flag1** in flagsOverview Activity changes to green, meaning we have successfully solved the challenge1.

![Flag one solved](/static/images/android/solved.png)

The flag for level1 is "**F1ag_0n3**".  
For other levels if solved successfully, the color of the flag corresponding to that level will change to green.

## FLAG TWO - EXPORTED ACTIVITY

Goal : **There is a way to bypass the main activity and invoke other activities that are exported.**

**What is an activity?**

An activity is a single, focused thing that the user can do. It is an application component that provide a user Interface for users to interact with.

Looking at the **flagtwoactivity**, the source code looks like the one shown below.

```java
public class FlagTwoActivity extends ActivityC0453c {

    /* renamed from: w */
    int f4461w = 0;

    /* renamed from: F */
    public /* synthetic */ void m4090F(View view) {
        int i = this.f4461w;
        if (i == 0) {
            Snackbar X = Snackbar.m2647X(view, "Key words Activity and exported.", 0);
            X.m2646Y("Action", null);
            X.mo2650N();
            this.f4461w++;
        } else if (i == 1) {
            Snackbar X2 = Snackbar.m2647X(view, "Exported Activities can be accessed with adb or Drozer.", 0);
            X2.m2646Y("Action", null);
            X2.mo2650N();
            this.f4461w = 0;
        }
    }

    /* access modifiers changed from: protected */
    @Override // androidx.appcompat.app.ActivityC0453c, androidx.fragment.app.ActivityC0797d, androidx.activity.ComponentActivity, androidx.core.app.ActivityC0714e, android.app.Activity
    public void onCreate(Bundle bundle) {
        super.onCreate(bundle);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_flag_two);
        m8078C((Toolbar) findViewById(R.id.toolbar));
        ((FloatingActionButton) findViewById(R.id.fab)).setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() { // from class: b3nac.injuredandroid.d
            @Override // android.view.View.OnClickListener
            public final void onClick(View view) {
                FlagTwoActivity.this.m4090F(view);
            }
        });
    }
}
```

The **oncreate** method is used for initializing our activity. The goal of the challenge is to invoke the flagtwoactivity from an external application. This activity is called **exported activity**, meaning it can be started outside the context of the application.

Activities in android are defined in a file called _AndroidManifest.xml_ .

```xml
<activity android:name="b3nac.injuredandroid.b25lActivity" android:exported="true"/>
```

As you see above, the activity **b3nac.injuredandroid.b25lActivity** can be invoked by external application because **android:exported** attribute is set to true.

For exploitation of the above issue we will use adb. First we use adb to list the installed packages in the device and grep the application of our interest using Linux grep utility.

```bash
vx@archie:~$ adb shell pm list packages | grep injuredandroid
package:b3nac.injuredandroid
```

**What happens when invoke b25lActivity class activity?**

When b25lActivity activity is invoked by an external program, it sets the flag2 color to green in the FlagsOverview activity.

```java
/* loaded from: classes.dex */
public final class b25lActivity extends ActivityC0453c {
    /* access modifiers changed from: protected */
    @Override // androidx.appcompat.app.ActivityC0453c, androidx.fragment.app.ActivityC0797d, androidx.activity.ComponentActivity, androidx.core.app.ActivityC0714e, android.app.Activity
    public void onCreate(Bundle bundle) {
        super.onCreate(bundle);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_b25l);
        ApplicationC1492j.f4506j.m4062a(this);
        new FlagsOverview().m4082M(true);
        new ApplicationC1492j().m4065b(this, "flagTwoButtonColor", true);
    }
}
```

Invoke the activity b25lActivity using adb. Other method of invoking exported activities is by creating an android application thats starts the activity of the target`s activity.

```bash
vx@archie:~$ adb shell am start  -n b3nac.injuredandroid/.b25lActivity
Starting: Intent { cmp=b3nac.injuredandroid/.b25lActivity }
```

when the activity two is started successfully by an external application, we are rewarded with a flag.

## FLAG THREE - RESOURCES

**Goal: Understanding how an application references Resources.**

**what are resources?**

Resources are used for anything from defining colors, images, layouts, menus and string values. Everything defined here is referenced in the application`s code.

The decompiled code for FlagThreeActivity is shown below.

```java
    public final void submitFlag(View view) {
        EditText editText = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.editText2);
        C2724g.m882d(editText, "editText2");
        if (C2724g.m885a(editText.getText().toString(), getString(R.string.cmVzb3VyY2VzX3lv))) {
            Intent intent = new Intent(this, FlagOneSuccess.class);
            new FlagsOverview().m4083L(true);
            new ApplicationC1492j().m4065b(this, "flagThreeButtonColor", true);
            startActivity(intent);
        }
    }
```

Looking at the above **submitFlag** function defined in **_FlagThreeActivity.java_**, we are comparing the user input with the value referenced at Resource **_cmVzb3VyY2VzX3lv_** . R stands for resource.

Looking at the strings we get our flags as referenced by the string above.

```shell
<string name="cmVzb3VyY2VzX3lv">F1ag_thr33</string>
```

The flag is **F1ag_thr33**

## FLAG FOUR - LOGIN2

**Goal: Get the right flag**

For flag four we analyze **FlagFourActivity.java.**. First we need figure out the logic implemented in the submitflag class in the code below.

```java
    public final void submitFlag(View view) {
        EditText editText = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.editText2);
        C2724g.m882d(editText, "editText2");
        String obj = editText.getText().toString();
        byte[] a = new C1489g().m4070a();
        C2724g.m882d(a, "decoder.getData()");
        if (C2724g.m885a(obj, new String(a, C2759c.f6854a))) {
            Intent intent = new Intent(this, FlagOneSuccess.class);
            new FlagsOverview().m4086I(true);
            new ApplicationC1492j().m4065b(this, "flagFourButtonColor", true);
            startActivity(intent);
        }
    }
```

From the above,we are are getting user input and comparing with bytes in variable a. To understand the logic we analyze the method **_c1489g_** and member class **_m4070a_**.

```java
public class C1489g {

    /* renamed from: a */
    private byte[] f4499a = Base64.decode("NF9vdmVyZG9uZV9vbWVsZXRz", 0);

    /* renamed from: a */
    public byte[] m4070a() {
        return this.f4499a;
    }
```

Looking at the public class **c1489g**, it implements base64 decoding of the byte string and returned to the **submitFlag** class .

To get the string we are returning we need to decode the encoded string using base64 utility installed in linux .

```shell
$ echo "NF9vdmVyZG9uZV9vbWVsZXRz" | base64 -d
4_overdone_omelets
```

Our flag is : **4_overdone_omelets**

## FLAG FIVE - EXPORTED BROADCAST RECEIVERS

**Goal:** **Understand how Broadcast receivers work**

Applications receive broadcasts in two ways:

1. Through manifest-declared receivers.
2. Context-registered receivers.

Manifest-declared receivers - This type causes the system to launch application when broadcast is received. Searching in AndroidManifest.xml file we get where our broadcast is declared.

```xml
<receiver android:name="b3nac.injuredandroid.FlagFiveReceiver" android:exported="true"/>
<activity android:theme="@style/AppTheme.NoActionBar" android:label="@string/title_activity_flag_five" android:name="b3nac.injuredandroid.FlagFiveActivity"/>
```

In order to understand the Broadcast receivers, we need to analyze the **oncreate()** method in the **FlagFiveActivity.java** file.

```java
public void onCreate(Bundle bundle) {
        super.onCreate(bundle);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_flag_five);
        m8078C((Toolbar) findViewById(R.id.toolbar));
        ((FloatingActionButton) findViewById(R.id.fab)).setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() { // from class: b3nac.injuredandroid.c
            @Override // android.view.View.OnClickListener
            public final void onClick(View view) {
                FlagFiveActivity.this.m4118G(view);
            }
        });
        new ComponentName(this, FlagFiveReceiver.class);
        getPackageManager();
        C0310a.m8404b(this).m8403c(this.f4409x, new IntentFilter("com.b3nac.injuredandroid.intent.action.CUSTOM_INTENT"));
        ((Button) findViewById(R.id.button9)).setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() { // from class: b3nac.injuredandroid.b
            @Override // android.view.View.OnClickListener
            public final void onClick(View view) {
                FlagFiveActivity.this.m4117H(view);   // invokes the intent
            }
        });
    }
```

From the above code, when we click flag2 button, we invoke intent which is defined in class **_m4117H_**.

An intent is used to perform an action on the screen. Therefore clicking the button element in our application we are invoking an new intent. Intents are used for sending a broadcast receiver.

```java
 /* renamed from: H */
    public /* synthetic */ void m4117H(View view) {
        m4119F();
    }

public void m4119F() {
        sendBroadcast(new Intent("com.b3nac.injuredandroid.intent.action.CUSTOM_INTENT"));
    }
```

Looking at the component name **FlagFiveReceiver** class. when the intent is invoked twice, we receive our flag. The class implements a conditional if else loop condition for checking the number of intents. when the correct flag is displayed, the intents counter is set to zero( **i2 = 0**), where **i2** variable is the intent counter as shown in the java code below.

```java
public final class FlagFiveReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {

    /* renamed from: a */
    private static int f4410a;

    @Override // android.content.BroadcastReceiver
    public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
        String str;
        int i;
        C2724g.m881e(context, "context");
        C2724g.m881e(intent, "intent");
        ApplicationC1492j.f4506j.m4062a(context);
        int i2 = f4410a;
        if (i2 == 0) {
            StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
            sb.append(C2765h.m809e("\n    Action: " + intent.getAction() + "\n\n    "));
            sb.append(C2765h.m809e("\n    URI: " + intent.toUri(1) + "\n\n    "));
            str = sb.toString();
            C2724g.m882d(str, "sb.toString()");
            Log.d("DUDE!:", str);
        } else {
            str = "Keep trying!";
            if (i2 != 1) {
                if (i2 == 2) {
                    new FlagsOverview().m4087H(true);
                    new ApplicationC1492j().m4065b(context, "flagFiveButtonColor", true);
                    Toast.makeText(context, "You are a winner " + C1494k.m4061a("Zkdlt0WwtLQ="), 1).show();
                    i = 0;
                    f4410a = i;
                }
                Toast.makeText(context, str, 1).show();
                return;
            }
        }
        Toast.makeText(context, str, 1).show();
        i = f4410a + 1;
        f4410a = i;
    }
}
```

**onReceive** method is responsible for receiving intents sent. Invoking our Activity two times we get a flag.

The flag for challenge five is **F1v3!**
