# Insecure Storages

This is the second part series of the android application security. This part focuses on the security of sqlite databases, firebase and AWS security.

## Flag7 - Sqlite
**What is sqlite?**

Sqlite is a structure query base database that enables applications to do local storage in the application directory. The goal of the challenge is to understand how local storage of databases may lead to leakage of information.

First step is to decompile the FlagSevenSqliteActivity using jadx.

During the analysis of new android activity, we start analysis on the onCreate method.**oncreate** is the first method to be called by an application when an activity is started. 

The decompiled oncreate method is as shown below.

```java
public void onCreate(Bundle bundle) {
    super.onCreate(bundle);
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_flag_seven_sqlite);
    C((Toolbar) findViewById(R.id.toolbar));
    j.g.a(this);
    H();
    ((FloatingActionButton) findViewById(R.id.fab)).setOnClickListener(new a());
    SQLiteDatabase writableDatabase = this.u.getWritableDatabase();
    ContentValues contentValues = new ContentValues();
    contentValues.put("title", Base64.decode("VGhlIGZsYWcgaGFzaCE=", 0));
    contentValues.put("subtitle", Base64.decode("MmFiOTYzOTBjN2RiZTM0MzlkZTc0ZDBjOWIwYjE3Njc=", 0));
    writableDatabase.insert("Thisisatest", null, contentValues);
    contentValues.put("title", Base64.decode("VGhlIGZsYWcgaXMgYWxzbyBhIHBhc3N3b3JkIQ==", 0));
    contentValues.put("subtitle", h.c());
    writableDatabase.insert("Thisisatest", null, contentValues);
}
```

From the analysis of the above code, the method is passing some base64 encoded strings and storing them into string variables.From the hint of application name, we are creating writable database through SQLiteDatabase functions. In this application we are writing some strings to the database. The name of the database being referenced is **Thisisatest** database.

Next step is decode all base64 encoded strings in order to understand the logic of the program. The decoded strings below.

```bash
VGhlIGZsYWcgaGFzaCE    - The flag hash! 
MmFiOTYzOTBjN2RiZTM0MzlkZTc0ZDBjOWIwYjE3Njc - 2ab96390c7dbe3439de74d0c9b0b1767
VGhlIGZsYWcgaXMgYWxzbyBhIHBhc3N3b3JkIQ  - The flag is also a password!
```
The above decoded strings gives us an hint on solving the challenge. The author provides us with the hash of the flag.

The activity defines some interesting strings in the application, we decode the strings as shown in the code below.

```kotlin
private final String w = "ZjFhZy1wYTU1";   #f1ag-pa55
private byte[] x = Base64.decode("c3FsaXRl", 0);  #sqlite
private byte[] y = Base64.decode(this.w, 0);
private final String z;
```

Next is to analyze the FlagSevensqliteActivity in order to understand the usage of the above strings in our activity. Important strings form the above are **f1ag-pa55** and **sqlite**.

```java

    public FlagSevenSqliteActivity() {
        byte[] bArr = this.x;      //sqlite
        d.m.b.d.b(bArr, "decodedDirectoryOne");
        Charset charset = StandardCharsets.UTF_8;
        d.m.b.d.b(charset, "StandardCharsets.UTF_8");
        this.z = new String(bArr, charset);
        byte[] bArr2 = this.y;        //f1ag-pa55
        d.m.b.d.b(bArr2, "decodedDirectoryTwo");
        Charset charset2 = StandardCharsets.UTF_8;
        d.m.b.d.b(charset2, "StandardCharsets.UTF_8");
        this.A = new String(bArr2, charset2);
        f b2 = f.b();
        d.m.b.d.b(b2, "FirebaseDatabase.getInstance()");
        d d2 = b2.d();
        d.m.b.d.b(d2, "FirebaseDatabase.getInstance().reference");
        this.B = d2;
        d h = d2.h(this.z);
        d.m.b.d.b(h, "database.child(refDirectory)");
        this.C = h;
        d h2 = this.B.h(this.A);
        d.m.b.d.b(h2, "database.child(refDirectoryTwo)");
        this.D = h2;
    }

```
From the above decompiled **flagSevensqliteActivity**, shows how the application is parsing the data from the firebase instance. In order to understand the data we are fetching, we need to know the nodes we are fetching the data from. From the decompiled code, we are accessing the string x as shown in the constructor method in line 1 through bArr byte array. our string is then passed to variable z constructor method as referenced by **this.z** constructor.

This means, **f1ag-pa55** and **sqlite** are our firebase nodes.

To get the firebase link, we look for the link the **strings.xml** in the resources directory of the application.The link of the firebase url is shown in the image below. Manually test firebase endpoints manually to see if they are vulnerable as shown in the code below. Adding .json at the end of the firebase endpoint enables one to read data.

First we test our endpoint using **sqlite** node.

```bash
vx@archie:output$ curl https://injuredandroid.firebaseio.com/sqlite.json
"S3V3N_11"
```
From the results of the above, we get our flag. Accessing the endpoint using **f1ag-pa55** using .json firebase trick, we get our password.

```bash
vx@archie:output$ curl https://injuredandroid.firebaseio.com/f1ag-pa55.json
"hunter2"
```
**hunter2** is our correct password for the challenge.


## FLag8 - AWS Storage and Security.
This challenge is about understanding the misconfiguration of AWS storage and security implementation in the android applications.

The decompiled flagEightclass activity code looks like the one below.

```java
public FlagEightLoginActivity() {
    f b2 = f.b();
    d.m.b.d.b(b2, "FirebaseDatabase.getInstance()");
    d d2 = b2.d();
    d.m.b.d.b(d2, "FirebaseDatabase.getInstance().reference");
    this.u = d2;
    d h = d2.h("/aws");
    d.m.b.d.b(h, "database.child(\"/aws\")");
    this.v = h;
}
```
The activity initializes firebase instance and fetches some information from the aws child node in the firebase storage model. Checking the above model if it is vulnerable to the .json trick of firebase, we get some information back as shown below

```bash
vx@archie:ret2csu$ curl https://injuredandroid.firebaseio.com/aws.json
"C10ud_S3cur1ty_lol"
```

Next step is to analyze the onClick method of the application. This is the method that responds to events of an application that if you click an object defined by the in the code.

```java
public final void onClick(View view) {
    if (FlagEightLoginActivity.this.H() == 0) {
        if (view != null) {
            Snackbar X = Snackbar.X(view, "AWS CLI.", 0);
            X.Y("Action", null);
            X.N();
            FlagEightLoginActivity flagEightLoginActivity = FlagEightLoginActivity.this;
            flagEightLoginActivity.I(flagEightLoginActivity.H() + 1);
            return;
        }
        d.m.b.d.k();
        throw null;
    } else if (FlagEightLoginActivity.this.H() != 1) {
    } else {
        if (view != null) {
            Snackbar X2 = Snackbar.X(view, "AWS profiles and credentials.", 0);
            X2.Y("Action", null);
            X2.N();
            FlagEightLoginActivity.this.I(0);
            return;
        }
        d.m.b.d.k();
        throw null;
    }
}

```

From the above hints provided in the application, gives hint on using of AWS CLI and understanding of AWS profiles and credentials.

**what are the AWS profile stored?**

Most of the strings are located in a file called **strings.xml** in the resources directory which are referenced throughout the application. In strings.xml file we have two interesting strings as shown in the code snippet below.

```xml
<string name="AWS_ID">AKIAZ36DGKTUIOLDOBN6</string>
<string name="AWS_SECRET">KKT4xQAQ5cKzJOsoSImlNFFTRxjYkoc71vuRP48S</string>

```

AWS CLI is a unified tool to manage your AWS services, this enables one to configure the aws services  through command line and automate them through scripts.
To install **aws-cli** on your linux machine type the following in your desktop terminal.

```bash
python -m pip install --user awscli
```

For adding the aws profile, use the following command in the terminal as shown below.
```bash
vx@archie:~$ aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [None]: AKIAZ36DGKTUIOLDOBN6
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: 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
```



## Flag9- FireBase

### What is firebase?
Google firebase is a mobile and web application development platform that provides a real-time database that continuously syncs data between the cloud and the userâ€™s mobile devices. Firebase databases are accessible via an API and that if developers have not correctly secured their firebase database, a simple web request can retrieve its entire content.

We need to analyze the FlagNineFirebaseActivity in order to understand how read and write rules are implemented in the application.

```java
 public final void goToFlagNineFirebaseActivity(View view) {
        startActivity(new Intent(this, FlagNineFirebaseActivity.class));
    }

```


```java
public FlagNineFirebaseActivity() {
    byte[] decode = Base64.decode("ZmxhZ3Mv", 0);     //  flags/ 
    this.v = decode;
    d.m.b.d.b(decode, "decodedDirectory");
    Charset charset = StandardCharsets.UTF_8;
    d.m.b.d.b(charset, "StandardCharsets.UTF_8");
    this.w = new String(decode, charset);
    f b2 = f.b();
    d.m.b.d.b(b2, "FirebaseDatabase.getInstance()");
    d d2 = b2.d();
    d.m.b.d.b(d2, "FirebaseDatabase.getInstance().reference");
    this.x = d2;
    d h = d2.h(this.w);
    d.m.b.d.b(h, "database.child(refDirectory)");
    this.y = h;
}
```
Decode the base64 encoded string in order to understand strings stored in the decode variable. To decode the string we use linux utility called base64.

```bash
vx@archie:~$ echo "ZmxhZ3Mv" | base64 -d
            flags/
```
From the above analysis,we are getting data from firebase storage, in the **flags** node.

Clicking on the hint view button in the application, we get hint on how to solve the challenge level. 
When the hint view is clicked it shows a string hint of **"Use the .json trick database url"** as shown in the decompiled code below.

```java
public final void onClick(View view) {
        String str;
        if (FlagNineFirebaseActivity.this.H() == 0) {
            if (view != null) {
                str = "Use the .json trick with database url";
            } else {
                d.m.b.d.k();
                throw null;
            }
        } else if (FlagNineFirebaseActivity.this.H() == 1) {
            if (view != null) {
                str = "Filenames.";
            } else {
                d.m.b.d.k();
                throw null;
            }

```

### Firebase Realtime Rules
Realtime database stores data as one large JSON tree and synchronized every time a new device is connected.The data received or stored in the database is determined by the security rules  of read and write.

Firebase allows read and write rules to the database to be set to true or false. when **.read** is set to true means describes if and data is allowed to be read by users and **.write** describes if and when data is allowed to be written.
Example of a firebase rule where read and write are allowed.

```json
{
    "rules": {
        ".read": true,
        ".write": true
    }
}
```
When read and write rules are enabled means that everyone with access to the application can read and write unauthorized data to the database.

The firebase database url is defined in **strings.xml** file in the resource section.

```xml
    <string name="firebase_database_url">https://injuredandroid.firebaseio.com</string>
```

The firebase node defined in our instance is **flags** node, to check if the endpoint node is vulnerable we append a **.json** at the end of the url node as shown in the image below.

```bash
vx@archie:injured$ curl https://injuredandroid.firebaseio.com/flags/.json
"[nine!_flag]"
```

If the url returns some data, that means that our endpoint is vulnerable. From the above output we were able to successfully solve the challenge.

### Securing Firebase
One can secure Firebase database by only allowing users of application to have only read permissions to a certain  tree node instead of allowing read to the root node in the application. This means the applications can not read data from the neighboring nodes.

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "flag": {
      ".read": true,
      ".write": false
    }
  }
}
