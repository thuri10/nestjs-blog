Hello, I`m Martin,

---

Martin is a Kenyan-born Software developer currently focusing on Application Security (Mobile and Web) and Backend Software development.

I like to play CTFs and poke around with new Technologies. That helps me to learn a ton of new stuff, grow as a developer and improve my technical skills by sharing my Learning experiences and Adventures.

Feel Free to contact me through <span style="color: green; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic">Mail</span> for any Question. I will be glad help or assist you.
