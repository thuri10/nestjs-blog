Hello, I`m Martin,

---

Martin is a Kenyan-born Software developer currently focusing on Application Security (Mobile and Web) and Backend Software development.

I play CTFs and poke around with new Technologies. That helps me to learn a ton of new stuff, grow as a developer and improve my technical skills.
